# Bubble Sort Implementation

This project demonstrates the bubble sort algorithm in C, a  sorting algorithm that uses comparisons and swaps to sort an array. The program sorts an array of 9 integers and displays this process by printing the array after every swap.

## Functions

### `printValues`
- **Description**: Prints the array in a single line surrounded by square brackets.
- **Input**: Pointer to an integer array.

### `swap`
- **Description**: Swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
- **Input**: Two integer pointers.

### `sort`
- **Description**: Implements the bubble sort algorithm.
  1. Compares adjacent elements in the array.
  2. Swaps them if they are out of order.
  3. Prints the array after each swap.
- **Input**: Pointer to an integer array.
